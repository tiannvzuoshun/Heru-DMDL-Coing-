// Here are a little confused to me:

//1 Now you have a current question number and an array of questions. All you need to do now is go back to the "Question 1 of 8" sting you created and swap out the number with what you know.  Remember that we are able to mix strings and variables by doing something like this: `let combinedString = `I am a string and ${variableName}``

// 2 Your string will have to insert 2 values. The first is the current question number which we named `currentQuestion`. The second is the length of the question array.  

//Should I do this way?(1+2):
let combineString =  `I am a string and ${combineString}`
       console.log (currentQuestion[2];response[1]);
       for (var i =0; i < combineString.length; i++){
         console.log (currentQuestion[i];response);}
